# Sentiment-Analysis
This project is an interactive web application that performs sentiment analysis while providing explainable insights into how the model arrives at its predictions. It combines the power of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to help users understand the “why” behind every sentiment classification.
